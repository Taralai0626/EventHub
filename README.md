<h1>Eventhub - A web application for event lovers <3 </h1>
The purpose of this website is to provide users the ability to search events at venues. Alongside this purpose, the website will also allow users to compare ticket prices from different online ticket vendors to give users the choice to buy the best priced ticket. Also, users who signed up and have logged in will be able to have access to the “My Events” page. This page allows users to save/edit/delete their favorite events, and also see if there are any upcoming events nearby based on their favorites. In addition, there will be a suggestion listing based on the similar interest of the user.
